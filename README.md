## What is this for?
This small repo contains a collection of PowerShell scripts documented on [CTT](https://dsc.gg/CTT). This list is likely to be outdated, go dive in the folders yourself for an up to date overview.

You can run each of them from URL (by invoking raw url as expression), most scripts are designed to automatically install any dependencies.
